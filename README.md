# Spine Blood Counter

Counts active Corrupted Bloods and Residues during the Spine of Deathwing encounter. The addon automaticly opens small window when it detects player entering the Spine of Deathwing encounter subzone and resets counters on pull. The window autohides after completing the fight or wiping (subzone changes in both cases).

Slash-commands:
- `/scount`, `/scounter` and `/spinecount` are all aliases so use what you like
- `/scount show` to show the window and you can place it where ever on the screen you like with mouse and left-click dragging before the fight so it doesn't block your view during the encounter
- `/scount hide` to hide the window (the window also autohide if you move out from zone or subzone to other)
